<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started: Quick Guide

Welcome to the quick guide to get you started with our SDK! In just a few simple steps, you'll be up and running with our library in a few minutes.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

##### Supported Device
Please note that our SDK is currently only supported on Clip Total devices, as it requires integration with the PinPad application installed on these devices.

##### Compose
You will need compose in order to use this SDK.

##### API Key
You'll need an API key to authenticate with our services. If you don't have one yet, you can generate it on the [Clip Developers](https://developer.clip.mx/reference/token-de-autenticacion#2-crea-un-token-de-autenticaci%C3%B3n-con-codificaci%C3%B3n-base64) page.

##### Dependency
To download the SDK dependency, you'll need to add JitPack to your Maven repositories. Follow these steps:

```settings.gradle.kts
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url = uri("https://jitpack.io") }
    }
}
```

And then add the dependency to `build.gradle.kts`.

```build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
    implementation("com.blaze.pinpad:pinpad-sdk:latest-version")
}
```

##### Installation Steps
- Add JitPack Repository: Open your settings.gradle.kts file and add the JitPack repository to your Maven repositories list.
- Add Dependency: Open your build.gradle.kts file and add the SDK dependency.

###### Stay Updated
We strongly recommend staying informed about new versions of our SDK and updating your library frequently. While we strive to provide clean updates with no breaking changes, keeping your SDK version up-to-date ensures you have access to the latest features and improvements.

## How to use the SDK?

Before initiating a payment, you'll need to obtain a request ID from our SDK. We've designed our SDK to separate the payment process from the creation of a payment request, allowing you to handle loading states according to your application's requirements.

```PaymentViewModel.kt
class PaymentViewModel : ViewModel() {

    private val _client = ClipPayment.Builder()
        .setUser(YOUR_CLIP_USER)
        .setApiKey(YOUR_CLIP_TOKEN)
        .build()

    fun onPay(amount: Double, message: String) = viewModelScope.launch {
        _client.create(amount, message)
            .onSuccess {
                handleCreationSuccess()
            }
            .onFailure {
                handleCreationFailure()
            }
    }
}
```

To ensure smooth integration of our SDK into your application, we recommend handling the payment logic within your ViewModel or a similar component. This approach helps to keep your codebase organized and maintainable.

Once you've successfully obtained the request ID, our SDK provides a launcher that simplifies the payment process and handles all the necessary results. Below is a sample implementation of the launcher:

```Payment.kt
@Composable
fun PaymentScreen() {
    val launcher = remember { ClipLauncherFactory.create() }

    launcher.setPaymentHandler(
        onSuccess = { handlePaymentSuccess() },
        onCancelled = { handlePaymentCancelled() },
        onFailure = { handlePaymentCancelled() }
    )

    Button(
        onClick = {
            launcher.startPayment(REQUEST_ID)
        }
    ) {
        Text(text = "START PAYMENT")
    }
}
```
