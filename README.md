### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

##### Supported Device
Please note that our SDK is currently only supported on Clip Total devices, as it requires integration with the PinPad application installed on these devices.

##### Dependency
To download the SDK dependency, you'll need to add Jitpack to your Maven repositories. Follow these steps:

```settings.gradle.kts
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url = uri("https://jitpack.io") }
    }
}
```

And then add the dependency to `build.gradle.kts`.

```build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.ClipMX:mobile.android.blaze.pinpad.sdk:latest-version")
}
```

##### Installation Steps
- Add Jitpack Repository: Open your settings.gradle.kts file and add Jitpack repository to your Maven repositories list.
- Add Dependency: Open your build.gradle.kts file and add the SDK dependency.

###### Stay Updated
We strongly recommend staying informed about new versions of our SDK and updating your library frequently. While we strive to provide clean updates with no breaking changes, keeping your SDK version up-to-date ensures you have access to the latest features and improvements.

## How to use the SDK?

Our payment SDK is designed to be incredibly user-friendly, allowing you to configure the client according to your specific needs. Below is an example implementation for basic usage in a Compose application:

Compose
```Payment.kt
@Composable
fun PaymentScreen() {
    val scope = rememberCoroutineScope()
    val client = remember {
        ClipPayment.Builder()
            // Configure your payment
            .build()
    }

    client.setPaymentHandler()

    Button(
        onClick = {
            scope.launch {
                client.start(
                    reference = REFERENCE,
                    amount = AMOUNT
                )
            }
        }
    ) {
        ...
    }
}
```

Activity
```Activity.kt
class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {

    private val builder: ClipPayment by lazy {
        ClipPayment.Builder()
            // Configure your payment
            .build()
    }

    init {
        builder.setPaymentHandler(this@MainActivity)
    }

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        lifecycleScope.launch {
            builder.start(
                reference = REFERENCE,
                amount = AMOUNT
            )
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, there are three vital components for client configuration:

1. **Client Initialization**: You must instantiate the client in your application.

Compose
```Payment.kt
val client = remember {
    ClipPayment.Builder()
        // Configure your payment
        .build()
}
```

Activity
```Activity.kt
private val builder: ClipPayment by lazy {
    ClipPayment.Builder()
        // Configure your payment
        .build()
}
```

2. **Payment Handler**: Payment handling is mandatory as the client needs to know the composable context to launch activities and handle results. If you are using Activity, be sure to call handler before activity onCreate.

Compose
```Payment.kt
@Composable
fun PaymentScreen() {
    ...

    client.setPaymentHandler()

    ...
}
```

Activity
```Activity.kt
init {
    builder.setPaymentHandler(this@MainActivity)
}
```

3. **Payment Launch**: With the client instantiated and the payment handler configured, you can call the launcher. This method requires two parameters: the amount to charge and a descriptive message about the payment.

```Payment.kt
scope.launch {
    client.start(
        reference = REFERENCE,
        amount = AMOUNT
    )
}
```

And that's it! With these steps, you can start processing payments in your application ðŸ¤‘

### Additional Configuration Parameters

Our payment SDK offers several additional configuration parameters to customize your integration experience. Below are explanations of each parameter and examples of how to use them:

- **isDemo**: This parameter allows you to toggle the usage of the Clip Demo Server. By default, it is set to false, meaning it operates with the production server for real payments. Setting it to true enables the use of the demo server, which is useful for testing purposes. By default, it is set to false.
```Payment.kt
    ClipPayment.Builder()
        .isDemo(isDemo: Boolean)
```

- **isAutoReturnEnabled**: This parameter sets the return mode for the terminal after a transaction. When set to true, the terminal automatically returns to your application after completing or encountering an error during the transaction process. If set to false, the terminal displays its own detailed screen explaining the situation. By default, it is set to false.
```Payment.kt
    ClipPayment.Builder()
        .isAutoReturnEnabled(isAutoReturnEnabled: Boolean)
```

- **setPaymentPreferences**: This parameter sets payment preferences.
  - **isQPSEnabled**: This parameter sets if the tip screen will be shown when the payment process starts or not. By default it is false, and the tip screen will not be shown.
  - **isMSIEnabled**: This parameter sets if the monthly interest-free installments will be enabled. By default it is false, and the qps will be disabled.
  - **isMCIEnabled**: This parameter sets if the monthly installments will be enabled. By default it is true, and the msi will be activated.
  - **isDCCEnabled**: This parameter sets if the dynamic currency convert will be enabled. By default it is true, and the mci will be activated.
  - **isTipEnabled**: This parameter sets if the tip screen will be shown when the payment process starts or not. By default it is false, and the tip screen will not be shown.
```Payment.kt
    ClipPayment.Builder()
        .setPaymentPreferences(preferences: PaymentPreferences)
```

- **addListener**: With this parameter, you can register a listener to receive transaction results. This allows you to handle the outcome of the transaction within your application.
```Payment.kt
    ClipPayment.Builder()
        .addListener(listener: PaymentListener)
```
