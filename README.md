## How to use the SDK?
<a name="how-to"></a>


Our payment SDK is designed to be incredibly user-friendly, allowing you to configure the client according to your specific needs. Below is an example implementation for basic usage in a Compose application:

Compose

    @Composable
    fun PaymentScreen() {
        val scope = rememberCoroutineScope()
        val client = remember {
            ClipPayment.Builder()
                .setUser(YOUR_CLIP_USER)
                .setApiKey(YOUR_CLIP_TOKEN)
                .build()
        }
    
        client.setPaymentHandler()
    
        Button(
            onClick = {
                scope.launch {
                    client.start(
                        amount = AMOUNT,
                        message = MESSAGE
                    )
               }
            }
        ) {
            ...
        }
    }


Activity

    class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    
        private val builder: ClipPayment by lazy {
            ClipPayment.Builder()
                .setUser(YOUR_CLIP_USER)
                .setApiKey(YOUR_CLIP_TOKEN)
                .build()
        }
    
        init {
            builder.setPaymentHandler(this@MainActivity)
        }
    
        override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    
            lifecycleScope.launch {
                builder.start(
                    reference = REFERENCE,
                    amount = AMOUNT,
                    message = MESSAGE
                )
            }
        }
    }




In this example, there are three vital components for client configuration:

1. **Client Initialization**: You must instantiate the client in your application. The client requires two mandatory parameters: your Clip user and the API key generated earlier.

Compose

    val client = remember {
        ClipPayment.Builder()
            .setUser(YOUR_CLIP_USER)
            .setApiKey(YOUR_CLIP_TOKEN)
            .build()
    }

Activity

    private val builder: ClipPayment by lazy {
        ClipPayment.Builder()
            .setUser(YOUR_CLIP_USER)
            .setApiKey(YOUR_CLIP_TOKEN)
            .build()
    }




2. **Payment Handler**: Payment handling is mandatory as the client needs to know the composable context to launch activities and handle results. If you are using Activity, be sure to call handler before activity onCreate.

Compose

    @Composable
    fun PaymentScreen() {
        ...
    
        client.setPaymentHandler()
    
        ...
    }

Activity

    init {
        builder.setPaymentHandler(this@MainActivity)
    }




3. **Payment Launch**: With the client instantiated and the payment handler configured, you can call the launcher. This method requires two parameters: the amount to charge and a descriptive message about the payment.


```Payment.kt  
scope.launch {  
  client.start(  
	  reference = REFERENCE,  
	  amount = AMOUNT,  
	  message = MESSAGE  
  )  
}  
  ```  


### Additional Configuration Parameters
<a name="additional-config"></a>


Our payment SDK offers several additional configuration parameters to customize your integration experience. Below are explanations of each parameter and examples of how to use them:



- **isDemo**: This parameter allows you to toggle the usage of the Clip Demo Server. By default, it is set to false, meaning it operates with the production server for real payments. Setting it to true enables the use of the demo server, which is useful for testing purposes. By default, it is set to false.

```Payment.kt  
  
ClipPayment.Builder()  
  
.isDemo(isDemo: Boolean)  
  
```  



- **isAutoReturnEnabled**: This parameter sets the return mode for the terminal after a transaction. When set to true, the terminal automatically returns to your application after completing or encountering an error during the transaction process. If set to false, the terminal displays its own detailed screen explaining the situation. By default, it is set to false.

```Payment.kt  
  
ClipPayment.Builder()  
  
.isAutoReturnEnabled(isAutoReturnEnabled: Boolean)  
  
```  



- **addListener**: With this parameter, you can register a listener to receive transaction results. This allows you to handle the outcome of the transaction within your application.

```Payment.kt  
  
ClipPayment.Builder()  
  
.addListener(listener: PaymentListener)  
  
```  



- **setLoadingState**: This parameter provides you with a loading state while our SDK is performing various tasks such as calling APIs. It accepts a MutableStateFlow<Boolean> parameter, allowing you to manage the loading state within your application.

```Payment.kt  
  
ClipPayment.Builder()  
  
.setLoadingState(state: MutableStateFlow<Boolean>)  
  
```  



<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>  



### Server Driven Integration
<a name="server-driven-int"></a>

It is necessary for you to register with Clip in order to develop with the APIs.

Having a Clip account will give you access to the Clip Dashboard, where you can manage your Clip payment devices and general account settings. A Clip account is also required to access the Developer Dashboard.

To create your Clip account:

1.- Go to [https://dashboard.clip.mx/onboard/register](https://dashboard.clip.mx/onboard/register)

Once we have our Clip Account created, we continue to generate token key values.

We need to enter to [clip account](https://dashboard.clip.mx/reporting) and follow next steps:



1.  Go to the developers portal.

	![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/3P72h6R6Nvx19vv6JUBiFqdcKaqa3voGd2WO2yDZQICvXr4GTwSmXTi4bQ8z5iN5UJcScqH60brw-T1glAkb4I6BmObPBx4bzHh-f3HJ4CAMhjuvFGoVnXaJQYZyK5GA22YODqDUZAH8-cev9iUuHW0)



2.  We continue creating our application


![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/f0RRfJZf2L_RvYW9ekPvUi-XsEdsCSBnjPQa5f_XnxdTa4yKeBcdkds_DTRjQd11uH6DvFPrV35TsL3-GoZtzNqwcRIcEweuBKTJ3ziVnFn3NoR4UEjJpNQohENP0Q1IVjvmEl7JyePZ_wD1TSwKYDM)






3.  We neet to assign a name, and then proceed to create


![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ovAlHNFMnqXicLK1ADK4hsVDZXNoqxy8UbKQZXGCb6nXrApM8PYeaN-oLKNuL5bwENU3-u45EKaR-s3ZekS_EO17VSUl4Xb89fKerBC7uqjpgUv0sfHFN_55NR8kWAvRb-4R8EGTQgEGWoZ3nwjw_GQ)



4.  When our application is created, it is important to save the API Key and Secret Key in a safe place. We need to use after


![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/1DhQJKhCYbwT2xr8cJtn1VXTQN5fhSGuWsIupZsDp8_V6ftHm7IgZh5-m01AhoOjR7pa-UBH0GvhUcH6hiVQwdntBxvSYoPGphaxkmmb2-9Iw94Dohpw6_-V9DP2QUj1_dXa-P4cMvJNLjrilXm1TSk)


5.  Finally, in the [Clip developers portal](https://developer.clip.mx/reference/token-de-autenticacion) with our previous keys, put the values in the fields as we can see in the next image.

	![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/FwyfiponSVsmYmoIXtWUhGmEwRHGTLW7ik4N1lfR4DTdTdqpcsAUvltQ_BjDK9VAeij_8TvZSREpwVAQOM4-VJuVb-el72kQAAnT015V1fuhl0ExYBXJOhVGBSYi3RVeb1De-Qrpjqgn_PjUFlKPvs8)


Finally we have a Basic value token for our next steps creating a request to the API in header authentication.


### Make your first API call
<a name="api-call"></a>

The API URL is configured and reached for the ME :

[https://api.payclip.io/f2f/pinpad/v1/payment](https://api.payclip.io/f2f/pinpad/v1/payment)


    curl --location 'https://api.payclip.io/f2f/pinpad/v1/payment' \
    --header 'Authorization: Basic {TOKEN}' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
	    "reference": "abc",
	    "amount": 0.23,
	    "serial_number_pos": "{SN}",
		"options": {
			"auto_return": true,
			"is_tip_enabled": true,
			"is_msi_enabled": true,
			"is_mci_enabled": true,
			"is_dcc_enabled": true
		}
    }'


With the last reference, we will continue to make our first request:
